         GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
         
         Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
         
         Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
         license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
         This GCC Runtime Library Exception (""Exception"") is an additional
         permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
         3 (""GPLv3""). It applies to a given file (the ""Runtime Library"") that
         bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
         the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
         
         When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
         certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
         program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
         non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
         header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
         
         0. Definitions.
         
         A file is an ""Independent Module"" if it either requires the Runtime
         Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
         interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
         on the Runtime Library.
         
         ""GCC"" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
         modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
         the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
         subsequent versions published by the FSF.
         
         ""GPL-compatible Software"" is software whose conditions of propagation,
         modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
         the license of GCC.
         
         ""Target Code"" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
         target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
         input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
         phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
         format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
         for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
         
         The ""Compilation Process"" transforms code entirely represented in
         non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
         Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
         use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
         part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
         understood as starting with the output of the generators or
         preprocessors.
         
         A Compilation Process is ""Eligible"" if it is done using GCC, alone or
         with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
         work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
         optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
         Eligible Compilation Process.
         
         1. Grant of Additional Permission.
         
         You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
         combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
         propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
         all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
         may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
         consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
         
         2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
         
         The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
         presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
         requirements of the license of GCC.

                             GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                                Version 3, 29 June 2007
         
          Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
                                     Preamble
         
           The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
         software and other kinds of works.
         
           The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
         to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
         the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
         share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
         software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
         GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
         any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
         your programs, too.
         
           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
         price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
         have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
         them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
         want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
         free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
         
           To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
         these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
         certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
         you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
         
           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
         gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
         freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
         or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
         know their rights.
         
           Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
         (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
         giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
         
           For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
         that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
         authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
         changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
         authors of previous versions.
         
           Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
         modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
         can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
         protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
         pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
         use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
         have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
         products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
         stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
         of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
         
           Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
         States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
         software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
         avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
         make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
         patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
         
           The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
         modification follow.
         
                                TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
           0. Definitions.
         
           ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
         
           ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
         works, such as semiconductor masks.
         
           ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
         License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and
         ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.
         
           To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
         in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
         exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the
         earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.
         
           A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
         on the Program.
         
           To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without
         permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
         infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
         computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
         distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
         public, and in some countries other activities as well.
         
           To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
         parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
         a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
         
           An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""
         to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
         feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
         tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
         extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
         work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
         the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
         menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
         
           1. Source Code.
         
           The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work
         for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source
         form of a work.
         
           A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official
         standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
         interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
         is widely used among developers working in that language.
         
           The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other
         than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
         packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
         Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
         Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
         implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
         ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component
         (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
         (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
         produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
         
           The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all
         the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
         work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
         control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
         System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
         programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
         which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
         includes interface definition files associated with source files for
         the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
         linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
         such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
         subprograms and other parts of the work.
         
           The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
         can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
         Source.
         
           The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
         same work.
         
           2. Basic Permissions.
         
           All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
         copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
         conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
         permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
         covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
         content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
         rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
         
           You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
         convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
         in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
         of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
         with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
         the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
         not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
         for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
         and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
         your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
         
           Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
         the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
         makes it unnecessary.
         
           3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
         
           No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
         measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
         11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
         similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
         measures.
         
           When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
         circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
         is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
         the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
         modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
         users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
         technological measures.
         
           4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
         
           You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
         receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
         appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
         keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
         non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
         keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
         recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
         
           You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
         and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
         
           5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
         
           You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
         produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
         terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
         
             a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
             it, and giving a relevant date.
         
             b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
             released under this License and any conditions added under section
             7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
             ""keep intact all notices"".
         
             c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
             License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
             License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
             additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
             regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
             permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
             invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
         
             d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
             Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
             interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
             work need not make them do so.
         
           A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
         works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
         and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
         in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
         ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
         used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
         beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
         in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
         parts of the aggregate.
         
           6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
         
           You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
         of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
         machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
         in one of these ways:
         
             a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
             (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
             Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
             customarily used for software interchange.
         
             b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
             (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
             written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
             long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
             model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
             copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
             product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
             medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
             more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
             conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
             Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
         
             c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
             written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
             alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
             only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
             with subsection 6b.
         
             d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
             place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
             Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
             further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
             Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
             copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
             may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
             that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
             clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
             Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
             Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
             available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
         
             e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
             you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
             Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
             charge under subsection 6d.
         
           A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
         from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
         included in conveying the object code work.
         
           A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any
         tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
         or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
         into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
         doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
         product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a
         typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
         of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
         actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
         is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
         commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
         the only significant mode of use of the product.
         
           ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,
         procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
         and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
         a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
         suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
         code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
         modification has been made.
         
           If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
         specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
         part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
         User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
         fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
         Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
         by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
         if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
         modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
         been installed in ROM).
         
           The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
         requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
         for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
         the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
         network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
         adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
         protocols for communication across the network.
         
           Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
         in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
         documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
         source code form), and must require no special password or key for
         unpacking, reading or copying.
         
           7. Additional Terms.
         
           ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this
         License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
         Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
         be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
         that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
         apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
         under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
         this License without regard to the additional permissions.
         
           When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
         remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
         it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
         removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
         additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
         for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
         
           Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
         add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
         that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
         
             a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
             terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
         
             b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
             author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
             Notices displayed by works containing it; or
         
             c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
             requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
             reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
         
             d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
             authors of the material; or
         
             e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
             trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
         
             f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
             material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
             it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
             any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
             those licensors and authors.
         
           All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further
         restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
         received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
         governed by this License along with a term that is a further
         restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
         a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
         License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
         of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
         not survive such relicensing or conveying.
         
           If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
         must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
         additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
         where to find the applicable terms.
         
           Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
         form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
         the above requirements apply either way.
         
           8. Termination.
         
           You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
         provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
         modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
         this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
         paragraph of section 11).
         
           However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
         license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
         provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
         finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
         holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
         prior to 60 days after the cessation.
         
           Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
         reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
         violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
         received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
         copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
         your receipt of the notice.
         
           Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
         licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
         this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
         reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
         material under section 10.
         
           9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
         
           You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
         run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
         occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
         to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
         nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
         modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
         not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
         covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
         
           10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
         
           Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
         receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
         propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
         for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
         
           An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an
         organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
         organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
         work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
         transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
         licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
         give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
         Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
         the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
         
           You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
         rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
         not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
         rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
         (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
         any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
         sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
         
           11. Patents.
         
           A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
         License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
         work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".
         
           A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims
         owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
         hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
         by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
         but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
         consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
         purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant
         patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
         this License.
         
           Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
         patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
         make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
         propagate the contents of its contributor version.
         
           In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express
         agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
         (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
         sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a
         party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
         patent against the party.
         
           If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
         and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
         to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
         publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
         then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
         available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
         patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
         consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
         license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have
         actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
         covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
         in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
         country that you have reason to believe are valid.
         
           If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
         arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
         covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
         receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
         or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
         you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
         work and works based on it.
         
           A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within
         the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
         conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
         specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
         work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
         in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
         to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
         the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
         parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
         patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
         conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
         for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
         contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
         or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
         
           Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
         any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
         otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
         
           12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
         
           If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
         otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
         excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
         covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
         License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
         not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
         to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
         the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
         License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
         
           13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
         
           Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
         permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
         under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
         combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
         License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
         but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
         section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
         combination as such.
         
           14. Revised Versions of this License.
         
           The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
         the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
         be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
         address new problems or concerns.
         
           Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
         Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
         Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the
         option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
         version or of any later version published by the Free Software
         Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
         GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
         by the Free Software Foundation.
         
           If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
         versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
         public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
         to choose that version for the Program.
         
           Later license versions may give you additional or different
         permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
         author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
         later version.
         
           15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
           THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
         APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
         HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY
         OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
         THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
         PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
         IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
         ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
         
           16. Limitation of Liability.
         
           IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
         WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
         THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
         GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
         USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
         DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
         PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
         EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
         SUCH DAMAGES.
         
           17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
         
           If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
         above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
         reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
         an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
         Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
         copy of the Program in return for a fee.
         
                              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
                     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
         
           If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
         possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
         free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
         
           To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
         to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
         state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
         the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
         
             <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
             Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
         
             This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
             it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
             the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
             (at your option) any later version.
         
             This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
             but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
             MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
             GNU General Public License for more details.
         
             You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
             along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
         
         Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
         
           If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
         notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
         
             <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
             This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
             This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
             under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
         
         The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
         parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
         might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".
         
           You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
         if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary.
         For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
         <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
         
           The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
         into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you

         The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
         src/regex/tre*) is Copyright ¬© 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
         under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
         included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
         the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.
         
         Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
         Copyright ¬© 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
         Copyright ¬© 2003-2011 David Schultz or

         and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
         have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.
         
         The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright ¬© 2008
         The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
         license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.
         
         The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are
         Copyright ¬© 1999-2019, Arm Limited.
         
         The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
         Copyright ¬© 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.
         
         The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
         originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
         domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
         in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.
         
         The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright ¬© 2011
         Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.
         
         The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
         the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
         Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
         by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
         integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
         licensed under the standard MIT terms.
         
         The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
         and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
         under the standard MIT terms.
         
         All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
         produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
         by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
         contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
         can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
         omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
         interest of source tree size.
         
         In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
         (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
         applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
         the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
         license, and to use these files without any requirement of
         attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:

         This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
         the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
         to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
         negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
         permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
         obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.

               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               ""Object"" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

               ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

               ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including

               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

         ==========================
         
         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
         
         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
         software.
         
         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
         
         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for
         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
         the various releases.

                             from                                compatible? (1)
         
             0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
             1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes

             2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
             1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
             2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
             2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
             2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
             2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
             2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
         
         Footnotes:
         
         (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
             the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
         
         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
             is ""not incompatible"" with the GPL.
         
         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
         direction to make these releases possible.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
         1. Definitions.

         available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
         in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
         ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
         shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
         name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
         ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
         of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works

         incorporated within the Work.
         
         2. Grant of Copyright License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
         Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.
         
         Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
         grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
         irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
         made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
         such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
         that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
         of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
         submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
         Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
         patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
         for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
         4. Redistribution.
         
         You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
         in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
         provided that You meet the following conditions:
         
         You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
         this License; and
         You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
         changed the files; and
         You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
         all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
         of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
         Derivative Works; and
         If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any
         Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
         attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
         that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
         following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
         Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
         with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
         Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
         the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
         License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
         You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
         provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
         modifying the License.
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
         with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions.
         
         Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
         for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
         conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
         any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
         such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks.
         
         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
         solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
         redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
         permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability.
         
         In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
         contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
         and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
         or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
         out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
         damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
         any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
         been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
         
         While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
         offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
         other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
         in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
         sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
         agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
         accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
         
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate

         recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on
         the same ""printed page"" as the copyright notice for easier identification within
         third-party archives.

         GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
         
         Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
         
         Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
         
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
         license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
         This GCC Runtime Library Exception (""Exception"") is an additional
         permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
         3 (""GPLv3""). It applies to a given file (the ""Runtime Library"") that
         bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
         the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
         
         When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
         certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
         program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
         non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
         header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
         
         0. Definitions.
         
         A file is an ""Independent Module"" if it either requires the Runtime
         Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
         interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
         on the Runtime Library.
         
         ""GCC"" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
         modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
         the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
         subsequent versions published by the FSF.
         
         ""GPL-compatible Software"" is software whose conditions of propagation,
         modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
         the license of GCC.
         
         ""Target Code"" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
         target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
         input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
         phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
         format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
         for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
         
         The ""Compilation Process"" transforms code entirely represented in
         non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
         Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
         use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
         part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
         understood as starting with the output of the generators or
         preprocessors.
         
         A Compilation Process is ""Eligible"" if it is done using GCC, alone or
         with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
         work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
         optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
         Eligible Compilation Process.
         
         1. Grant of Additional Permission.
         
         You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
         combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
         propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
         all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
         may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
         consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
         
         2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
         
         The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
         presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
         requirements of the license of GCC.

                             GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                                Version 3, 29 June 2007
         
          Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
                                     Preamble
         
           The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
         software and other kinds of works.
         
           The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
         to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
         the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
         share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
         software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
         GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
         any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
         your programs, too.
         
           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
         price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
         have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
         them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
         want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
         free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
         
           To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
         these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
         certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
         you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
         
           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
         gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
         freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
         or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
         know their rights.
         
           Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
         (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
         giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
         
           For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
         that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
         authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
         changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
         authors of previous versions.
         
           Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
         modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
         can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
         protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
         pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
         use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
         have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
         products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
         stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
         of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
         
           Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
         States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
         software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
         avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
         make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
         patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
         
           The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
         modification follow.
         
                                TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
           0. Definitions.
         
           ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
         
           ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
         works, such as semiconductor masks.
         
           ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
         License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and
         ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.
         
           To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
         in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
         exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the
         earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.
         
           A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
         on the Program.
         
           To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without
         permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
         infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
         computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
         distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
         public, and in some countries other activities as well.
         
           To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
         parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
         a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
         
           An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""
         to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
         feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
         tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
         extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
         work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
         the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
         menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
         
           1. Source Code.
         
           The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work
         for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source
         form of a work.
         
           A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official
         standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
         interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
         is widely used among developers working in that language.
         
           The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other
         than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
         packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
         Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
         Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
         implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
         ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component
         (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
         (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
         produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
         
           The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all
         the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
         work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
         control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
         System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
         programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
         which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
         includes interface definition files associated with source files for
         the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
         linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
         such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
         subprograms and other parts of the work.
         
           The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
         can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
         Source.
         
           The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
         same work.
         
           2. Basic Permissions.
         
           All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
         copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
         conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
         permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
         covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
         content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
         rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
         
           You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
         convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
         in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
         of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
         with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
         the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
         not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
         for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
         and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
         your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
         
           Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
         the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
         makes it unnecessary.
         
           3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
         
           No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
         measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
         11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
         similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
         measures.
         
           When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
         circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
         is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
         the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
         modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
         users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
         technological measures.
         
           4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
         
           You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
         receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
         appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
         keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
         non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
         keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
         recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
         
           You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
         and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
         
           5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
         
           You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
         produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
         terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
         
             a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
             it, and giving a relevant date.
         
             b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
             released under this License and any conditions added under section
             7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
             ""keep intact all notices"".
         
             c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
             License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
             License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
             additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
             regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
             permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
             invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
         
             d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
             Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
             interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
             work need not make them do so.
         
           A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
         works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
         and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
         in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
         ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
         used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
         beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
         in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
         parts of the aggregate.
         
           6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
         
           You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
         of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
         machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
         in one of these ways:
         
             a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
             (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
             Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
             customarily used for software interchange.
         
             b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
             (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
             written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
             long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
             model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
             copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
             product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
             medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
             more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
             conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
             Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
         
             c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
             written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
             alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
             only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
             with subsection 6b.
         
             d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
             place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
             Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
             further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
             Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
             copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
             may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
             that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
             clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
             Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
             Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
             available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
         
             e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
             you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
             Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
             charge under subsection 6d.
         
           A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
         from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
         included in conveying the object code work.
         
           A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any
         tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
         or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
         into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
         doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
         product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a
         typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
         of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
         actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
         is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
         commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
         the only significant mode of use of the product.
         
           ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods,
         procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
         and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
         a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
         suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
         code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
         modification has been made.
         
           If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
         specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
         part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
         User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
         fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
         Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
         by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
         if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
         modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
         been installed in ROM).
         
           The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
         requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
         for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
         the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
         network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
         adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
         protocols for communication across the network.
         
           Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
         in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
         documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
         source code form), and must require no special password or key for
         unpacking, reading or copying.
         
           7. Additional Terms.
         
           ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this
         License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
         Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
         be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
         that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
         apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
         under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
         this License without regard to the additional permissions.
         
           When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
         remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
         it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
         removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
         additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
         for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
         
           Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
         add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
         that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
         
             a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
             terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
         
             b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
             author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
             Notices displayed by works containing it; or
         
             c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
             requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
             reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
         
             d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
             authors of the material; or
         
             e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
             trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
         
             f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
             material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
             it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
             any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
             those licensors and authors.
         
           All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further
         restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
         received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
         governed by this License along with a term that is a further
         restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
         a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
         License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
         of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
         not survive such relicensing or conveying.
         
           If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
         must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
         additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
         where to find the applicable terms.
         
           Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
         form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
         the above requirements apply either way.
         
           8. Termination.
         
           You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
         provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
         modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
         this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
         paragraph of section 11).
         
           However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
         license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
         provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
         finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
         holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
         prior to 60 days after the cessation.
         
           Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
         reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
         violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
         received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
         copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
         your receipt of the notice.
         
           Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
         licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
         this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
         reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
         material under section 10.
         
           9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
         
           You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
         run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
         occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
         to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
         nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
         modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
         not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
         covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
         
           10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
         
           Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
         receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
         propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
         for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
         
           An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an
         organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
         organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
         work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
         transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
         licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
         give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
         Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
         the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
         
           You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
         rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
         not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
         rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
         (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
         any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
         sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
         
           11. Patents.
         
           A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
         License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
         work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".
         
           A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims
         owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
         hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
         by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
         but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
         consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
         purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant
         patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
         this License.
         
           Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
         patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
         make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
         propagate the contents of its contributor version.
         
           In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express
         agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
         (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
         sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a
         party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
         patent against the party.
         
           If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
         and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
         to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
         publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
         then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
         available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
         patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
         consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
         license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have
         actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
         covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
         in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
         country that you have reason to believe are valid.
         
           If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
         arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
         covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
         receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
         or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
         you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
         work and works based on it.
         
           A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within
         the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
         conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
         specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
         work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
         in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
         to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
         the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
         parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
         patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
         conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
         for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
         contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
         or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
         
           Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
         any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
         otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
         
           12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
         
           If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
         otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
         excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
         covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
         License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
         not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
         to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
         the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
         License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
         
           13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
         
           Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
         permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
         under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
         combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
         License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
         but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
         section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
         combination as such.
         
           14. Revised Versions of this License.
         
           The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
         the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
         be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
         address new problems or concerns.
         
           Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
         Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
         Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the
         option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
         version or of any later version published by the Free Software
         Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
         GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
         by the Free Software Foundation.
         
           If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
         versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
         public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
         to choose that version for the Program.
         
           Later license versions may give you additional or different
         permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
         author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
         later version.
         
           15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
         
           THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
         APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
         HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY
         OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
         THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
         PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
         IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
         ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
         
           16. Limitation of Liability.
         
           IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
         WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
         THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
         GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
         USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
         DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
         PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
         EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
         SUCH DAMAGES.
         
           17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
         
           If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
         above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
         reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
         an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
         Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
         copy of the Program in return for a fee.
         
                              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
                     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
         
           If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
         possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
         free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
         
           To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
         to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
         state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
         the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        Our Copyright Policy
        --------------------
        Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
        over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
        contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
        source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
        institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
        Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
        changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
        their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
        change to one of the Nucleic repositories.
        
        With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
        to indicate the copyright and license terms:

199.0,typedload,84448902.0,2.37,Load and dump data from json-like format into typed data structures,"This software is released under the GNU General Public License 3.  An exception to this is granted to Appgate Cybersecurity, Inc., which is allowed to use this software under the GNU Lesser General Public License 3. Because the author works there.  Verbatim text of GNU GPL 3 and GNU LGPL 3 follows.  ===================================================================== GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS  0. Definitions.  ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.  ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".  ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations.  To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work.  A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  1. Source Code.  The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work.  A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.  The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.  2. Basic Permissions.  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"".  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.  A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.  ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.  7. Additional Terms.  ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.  8. Termination.  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  11. Patents.  A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"".  A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.  In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.  A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.  14. Revised Versions of this License.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"".  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>. ============================================================================  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.  0. Additional Definitions.  As used herein, ""this License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the ""GNU GPL"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  ""The Library"" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.  An ""Application"" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.  A ""Combined Work"" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the ""Linked Version"".  The ""Minimal Corresponding Source"" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.  The ""Corresponding Application Code"" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.  2. Conveying Modified Versions.  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:  a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or  b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.  4. Combined Works.  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.  c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.  d) Do one of the following:  0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.  1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.  e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)  5. Combined Libraries.  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, ""submitted""
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              ""License"" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              ""Licensor"" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              ""Legal Entity"" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              ""You"" (or ""Your"") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              ""Source"" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              ""Object"" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, ""submitted""
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""
        
              ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets ""{}""
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same ""printed page"" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              ""License"" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              ""Licensor"" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              ""Legal Entity"" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              ""You"" (or ""Your"") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              ""Source"" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              ""Object"" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, ""submitted""
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""
        
              ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets ""[]""
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same ""printed page"" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

              ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              ""Source"" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, ""submitted""
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
as modifying the License. 
 
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
the conditions stated in this License. 
 
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
 
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              ""License"" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              ""Licensor"" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              ""Legal Entity"" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              ""You"" (or ""Your"") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              ""Source"" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              ""Object"" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, ""submitted""
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""
        
              ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
